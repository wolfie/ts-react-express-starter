# TypeScript, React and Express Starter Project

A template project where there's a start for React as a front-end and Express as a back-end, all with TypeScript.

Some buzzwords:

- React
- TypeScript
- Babel
- Webpack
- Yarn Workspaces
- Hot Reload

## Usage

This requires Yarn to work.

### Install

Start with installing all requried dependencies, and creating all appropriate symlinks between dependencies

```console
$ yarn
```

### Development Mode

To start development mode:

```console
$ yarn start
```

This starts _two_ servers on localhost, on ports 8080 and 8081. Open http://localhost:8080 to serve the files from `/frontend` - React and all that. localhost:8081 is where the `/server` stuff is, i.e. Express.

### Testing

To run all tests in the project, you can simply run

```console
$ yarn test
```

### Production Build

To package everything into a production ready bundle, run:

```console
$ yarn build        # this compiles everything into dist/
$ yarn start:build  # this will launch the express server in production mode on port 80
```

Production mode differs from Development Mode in the way that there is only one server: Express. This serves the React file directly from http://localhost/ root (note, the default HTTP port: 80). All REST paths are moved to a prefix of `/api`, on the same server.

All this happens automatically by the configurations.

## General Notes

The one/two servers difference is only to make the setup of the project as (technically) simple as possible, while suitable for as many as possible. You should be able to start using any of the three, together or separately, with minimal reconfiguration required.
